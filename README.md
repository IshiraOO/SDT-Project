ColomboAir is a web-based air quality monitoring system designed to track and analyze pollution levels in Colombo. The platform collects real-time data from environmental sensors placed in different locations and presents it through a user-friendly interface. Users can view current air quality information, while administrators have access to a secure dashboard to manage sensors, users, and alerts. 
  The system also stores historical data, allowing for trend analysis and informed decision-making. APIs are integrated to retrieve sensor data dynamically, ensuring up-to-date information is always available. ColomboAir helps authorities and the public stay aware of environmental conditions and respond to pollution more effectively.
